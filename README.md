**PinBall Game**  

**Purpose:**  
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive game that simulates a pinball machine. It aims to provide entertainment and challenge to players by requiring them to control a paddle to bounce a ball and score points.  

**Features:**  
1. **Game Elements:** The game includes a ball, a paddle, and borders to create a playing area.  
2. **Scoring:** Players score points by bouncing the ball off the paddle and preventing it from falling off the bottom of the screen.  
3. **Paddle Control:** Players can move the paddle left and right to intercept the ball.  
4. **Color Changing Ball:** The color of the ball changes after each bounce on the paddle.  
5. **Increasing Difficulty:** The speed of the ball increases after each bounce on the paddle.  
6. **Game Over:** The game ends when the ball falls off the bottom of the screen.  
7. **Restart:** Players can restart the game by pressing the 'R' key after it's over.  

**Outcome:**  
The outcome of this project is a fully functional pinball game that can be played in the Turtle graphics window. Players can enjoy trying to beat their high score and improve their reflexes by controlling the paddle to keep the ball in play.
